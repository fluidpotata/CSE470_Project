# Disaster Management System

Every year we face flood in our northern region, occasionally in the southern region as well. Recent events in Feni, Cumilla, Mymensingh has showed us how unprepared we are for these natural disasters, and how mismanagement can lead to a chaos. There are also the tropical cyclones and hurricanes. Also Dhaka and nearby regions are on multiple active fault lines, so any time a major earthquake can hit us and cause unimaiginable damage.
So if we have a central system that'll pre prepare infos of emergency contacts, shelters, available blood doners and keep track of items, and during a disaster provide infos of fund/item collection points, contatcs to get help and create a list of whoever needs help, it will help everyone. That is our goal through this project.
